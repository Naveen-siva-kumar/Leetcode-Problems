â€‹BASIC IDEA:

	As we encounter the ( bracket then increase the open variable.As we encounter ) bracket if some open ( bracket already exists then just assign that to this ) bracket and decrease the open ( brackets value, if there are no open ) brackets then increase the cost by one and one more thing we must check is, current position's next character also must be  ) bracket(open, close, close) . So check if it is. If it's not or we are standing at end of the string then increase the cost.
